My first attempt at a React App. I shouldn't have use CRA (create-react-app) because I wasn't able to geta full understanding of what goes on under the hood. Next time I will try and build the project from scratch, that way I can see what is actually happening instead of just using code that I don't know how it works. 


My first project in React and also my first time using command line for installing. I've come a long way from this.
